    <em:description>Automatically upload .torrent files to your favorite BitTorrent client's Web Interface.</em:description>
    <!--em:description>This Firefox extension allows you to simply click a download link for a torrent file and have it automatically uploaded to your Bit Torrent client through your preferred web interface. This is especially useful if you do a lot of browsing on a different computer than the one which is running your Bit Torrent client.

Supported Clients:
* Vuze and Azureus are supported through the following Remote Control plugins
  - AzSMRC
  - HTML WebUI
  - Swing WebUI
* uTorrent
* Deluge
* ruTorrent webui for rTorrent
* Transmission BT
* qBittorent

Important Notes:
* Be aware this addon is for use with WebUI interfaces and does not work with uTorrent Remote.
* uTorrent 3.0 still supports enabling classic WebUI interfaces through the options.
* Deluge magnet support requires Deluge 1.3.5 or greater.
* ruTorrent and deluge installations can be configured with the path option. Be aware that the path is case sensitive.
* Make sure you are running the latest version to get all the supported features. If the version has not been reviewed by Mozilla you may be required to manually update to that version using the links below.
* Thanks go to http://www.kphservices.com for the free seedbox they donated for client testing.
* Email bug reports and feature requests to bunta@orcon.net.nz instead of adding a review but make sure you are using the latest version first.
